If you're an Webkit browser user, you can either \r\n\tupgrade your tinyMCE editor to a newer version, or wait for \r\n\tWordPress 3.0.1 (should be out soon)\r\n  - Internet Explorer loses focus and updating contents doesn't work.\r\n    I'll do my best to fix it as soon as I can.\r\n  - Opera and Firefox seem to be working just fine :)\r\n* couple minor bugfixes\r\n\r\n= 1.5.7 =\r\n* July 3rd, 2010\r\n* added option to disable file gallery shortcode handler (if you want  \r\n  to use File Gallery functionality in backend only)\r\n* added options to link a gallery or single images to some external url\r\n* fixed the post thumb -1 (WPRemoveThumbnail nonce) bug\r\n\r\n= 1.5.6 =\r\n* June 19th, 2010\r\n* added 'include' and 'exclude' parameters for compatibility with \r\n  standard WP gallery shortcode function.
